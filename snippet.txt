Git Debug tools

Everyone knows Git as a great file versioning tool. But did you know you can also use Git to debug and to help you find bugs in your code?

In this snippet, I'll explain about two tools that helps me a lot and how I use then. The tools are: git blame and git bisect. We can use them in different scenarios and together.

Git blame

Git blame is a well know tool, basically, you can use to check what commit modify certain line of code. In the following example, the tool is used in the README.md file. The first column is the partial commit hash followed by user, date, time, time zone, line number, line content.
